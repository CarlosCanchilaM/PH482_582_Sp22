# Submission Details

## Submission Format

You will submit the Jupyter Notebooks as PDF.
In Google Colab a PDF can be exported under `File` `Print` and then it depends on your operating system.
For details on the submission of the exercises see [here](/Exercises/SubmissionDetails.md).

## File Name Convention

Easiest to explain with an example: For exercise 1 `01_Classification.ipynb` you will append your
group's name and the names of the members. So for group `42` and group members `Richard Stallman` and `Linus Torvalds` the file name will be `01_Classification_Group42_Stallman_Torvalds.pdf`.

In case you have to submit more than the one PDF, put all files in one ZIP which in above example would be `01_Classification_Group42_Stallman_Torvalds.zip`.
